# COMPUTER GRAPHICS FROM SCRATCH

> **Note:** This repository will contain all my code and notes from [Gabriel Gambetta](https://gabrielgambetta.com/)'s book: "Computer graphics from Scratch". As its name suggests, this book is an introduction to computer graphics, from very basic highschool knowledge to a Raytracer and a Rasterizer.
> I chose JS as language for this project in order to save time and focus myself on the theory rather than the tools, practicing with an easy language. The aim is to learn enough to be able to work on more consistent projects right after this book.
